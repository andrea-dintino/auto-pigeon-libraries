## 5. Consumption mechanism — partially open

How a consumer depends on a package here is **settled for development and open
for deployment**. Stated honestly rather than presented as finished:

- **Preferred:** a local-path dependency (`file:../auto-pigeon-libraries/ts/<pkg>`
  or a Go `replace` directive). Simplest, and it makes a change visible to its
  consumer immediately.
- **Fallback:** a git-URL dependency, pinned to a commit.
- **Deferred:** npm publication and Go module publication. Not done, not
  scheduled, and not to be introduced as a side effect of another task.

### Known unsolved issue: Docker build context

**A local-path dependency points outside a consuming repository's Docker build
context.** `docker build` cannot see `../auto-pigeon-libraries/`, so a consumer
that works locally will fail to build its image, and it will fail at image-build
time rather than at development time — the least convenient moment to discover
it.

This is written down so no one trips on it silently. **The decision about how a
given repository's `docker build` resolves the dependency** — a larger build
context, a vendoring step, a git-URL dependency for the image only, or
publication — **belongs to the adoption prompt in that consuming repository, not
to this repository.** The first adoption in each repo makes that call and
records it there.


## 7. No Dockerfile

This repository ships libraries, not a service. The standing workspace rule
that a repository must be Docker-deployable has a precondition — a deployable
image — and that precondition does not hold here.

**Do not add a Dockerfile to this repository out of habit.** If a task appears
to need one, the need belongs to a consuming repository (§5).
