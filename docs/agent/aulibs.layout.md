# Layout — one folder per package, and what each one must contain

```

Rules:

- **One folder per package** under `ts/` and `go/`. No nesting packages inside
  packages, no shared-source folder that several packages reach into.
- **Every package folder contains its own `used-by.json`**, validating against
  `meta/used-by.schema.json`, and its own `README.md` saying what the package
  is and how to use it.
- `fixtures/` is shared and has its own conventions — see `fixtures/README.md`.
  Read it before adding a fixture; the conventions were agreed before the first
  fixture existed precisely so they would hold.
