### 2.1 Validation is on-demand only

Library functions may check maps — schema, convexity, holes, anything — **when
called**. Nothing in AULIBS may be designed to run automatically: not at load
time, not at save time, not on a timer, not in a background worker, not as a
side effect of a constructor or an import.

The reason is a fact about how the product is used. Levels are routinely
"broken" simply because someone is still working on them; a half-carved brush
is a normal intermediate state, not an error. **No component ever wakes up and
declares a map broken.** A caller who wants a verdict asks for one and decides
what to do with it.

This shapes the API surface, not just the scheduling: a validation result is a
returned value, never a thrown exception on a load path, never a log line
emitted from a code path the caller did not ask to validate.
